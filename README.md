## About Us

At Bodkin Interactive, our passion lies in bringing fresh, engaging gameplay to life. Our current project, **Fields of Renown**, is a medieval sandbox RPG that blends strategy, adventure, and sandbox experiences set in 13th-century Gwynedd, North West Wales.

## Fields of Renown

**Fields of Renown** offers players the opportunity to:

- **Explore** the rugged landscapes of medieval Wales.
- **Engage** in activities such as fishing, farming, and trading.
- **Develop** skills and level up various abilities.
- **Experience** dynamic weather and seasonal changes.
- **Participate** in combat scenarios to defend your holdings.

We are currently evaluating game engines, with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) under consideration, to ensure the best possible experience for our players.
